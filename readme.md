At what point does it stop being quicker to use the "+30 seconds" button on the microwave?

Whenever we type a time into the microwave, we have to hit "Start". This adds a constant +1 to every typed time.

At times less than 30, pressing "+30 seconds" is just a single press and automatically starts the microwave without the "Start" button, which is obviously faster than writing any time. As the time goes up, the amount of times we have to press "+30 seconds" goes up linearly.

The amount of buttons required to enter a time is not so simple. The seconds place can hold up to 99 seconds, but we can only carry seconds into minutes by 60. It takes four button presses to type anything between 100 and 639 seconds (nine minutes and 99 seconds). 

The maximum for 5 presses is 6039 (99 minutes and 99 seconds). The max for 6 buttons would be 60039 (999 minutes and 99 seconds) if your microwave has more than four digits. You can keep adding a 0 for every additional button.

There is never a time where typing out a time and adding 30 seconds is faster than just typing out the total time. 

Here is the graph.

You can see that the lines meet at 61 seconds. This is where "6-1-Start" and "+30+30+30" meet. Both lines match between 61 and 90. Typing the numbers is briefly shorter between 90 and 99. They are briefly equal between 100 and 120. Then, typing out the number becomes quicker into infinity. This is a log curve falling under a linear curve.

While seconds < 61, "+30 seconds" is faster than typing out the number.

While seconds >= 61, typing out the number is *as fast or faster* than hitting the "+30 seconds" button over three or more times. 

Typing out the number also gives you time precision, so you don't have to stop the microwave early or have your food get too hot. 

In conclusion, we get this general rule: If your time is longer than 60 seconds, you should type it out. You should never have to hit "+30 seconds" more than twice.
